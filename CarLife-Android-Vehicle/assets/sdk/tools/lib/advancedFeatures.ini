# GLPipeChecksum----------------------------------------------------------------
# For every GL call that transfers between host and guest, GLPipeChecksum = on
# will compute a checksum consisting of some function of the actual bit vector
# corresponding to the GL command, verifying that the same checksum shows up
# on both the host and guest. Violations of the checksum (mismatches) result
# in an abort() and crash report being sent.
#
# Currently, the checksum is mainly making sure that the command itself and all
# arrays passed through the pipe are of proper length.
GLPipeChecksum = on

# GrallocSync-------------------------------------------------------------------
# Most apps that display images do so through OpenGL, but there are some apps
# that write directly to gralloc color buffers. In our goldfish-driver gralloc
# implementation, which represents gralloc color buffers as host OpenGL color
# buffers.
#
# For example, in the camera app, the emulated webcam driver will pull frames
# to a gralloc color buffer directly, and then in another thread or process,
# the color buffer representing the camera frame preview could be posted
# onscreen.
#
# These operations aren't guaranteed to have their order preserved when arriving
# from the guest, and if executed on the host in the wrong order, we could
# end up with out of order webcam frames, for instance.
#
# GrallocSync = on adds synchronization to the host for this use case where apps
# directly write to gralloc color buffers and then post them.
GrallocSync = on
